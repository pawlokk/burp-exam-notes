this fools the referer header so that it includes the legit website as query string
you can also try to append or prepend as subdomains
also pay attention to Referrer-Policy header (and the spelling, as Referer header is spelled incorrectly)

it might be possible that the web app also does not check the referer if its not present at all:
<meta name="referrer" content="never">
then add this to the HTML source
