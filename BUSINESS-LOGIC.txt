    Study the proxy history. Observe that when you place an order, the POST /cart/checkout request redirects you to an order confirmation page. Send GET /cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmation=true to Burp Repeater.
    Add the leather jacket to your basket.
    In Burp Repeater, resend the order confirmation request. Observe that the order is completed without the cost being deducted from your store credit and the lab is solved.
